# Supported Engines

This project is a work in progress. We're starting with the most common engines and the most common config settings so it's possible you may find an engine or config setting that's not supported yet. Please submit pull requests for these. It's not hard, it's just tedious to do all the copy/paste. We'd love collaboration on this project

If you don't have time for a pull request, please [enter a ticket](https://ortussolutions.atlassian.net/projects/CFCONFIG) so we can track remaining features.

Here's an overview of what's supported.

* **Lucee 4.x/5.x** - Nearly complete.  Missing custom tags, debugging, REST mappings, error settings, component settings
* **Adobe CF2018** - Experimental
* **Adobe CF2016** - Nearly complete.  
* **Adobe CF11** - Nearly complete.  
* **Adobe CF10** - No support yet
* **Adobe CF9** - No support yet
* **Railo 4.x** - No support yet.  Probably can heavily reuse from Lucee 4.x
